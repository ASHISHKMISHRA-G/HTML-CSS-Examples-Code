 Styles are additional attributes defined for HTML elements to make them more attractive and responsive.
- Styles can be configured for elements in a page by using 3 techniques

    a) Inline
    b) Embedded
    c) External Style Sheet

1. Inline Styles:
- The style attributes are defined for every element individually by using "style" attribute.

Syntax:
    <div style="key:value; key:value"> </div>

- They are faster in rendering.
- You can't reuse the styles.

EX:
 <h1 style="background-color:red; color:white; text-align:center">  Text </h1>

2. Embedded:
- In this technique the styles are written in a <style> container.
- You can embed the container in <head> or <body>.
- You can reuse the styles for various elements.
- It is slower in rendering when compared to inline.

Syntax:
  <head>
      <style>
           h1 {
    color:white;
    background-color:red;
    }
     </style>
</head>
<body>
   <h1> HTML </h1>
   <h1> CSS </h1>
</body>
